# Swagger and Micro-Services #

## Description ##

* Microservice architecture structures applications as a collection of loosely coupled services
* More than 70 percent of companies want to intensify their usage of Micro-services in 2017 according to <a href="./media/leanIX_Microservices-Study.pdf" target="_blank">leanIX study</a>
* Motivations behind micro-services adoption:
  * improvement in IT agility by reducing risk of big-bang releases and/or re-tooling
  * easier development maintainability with simpler code base
  * easier operation with automated CD (continuous deployment) and CI (continuous integration)
  * improved system resilience where failure of a service does not take down the entire system
* Micro-service architecture is not a silver bullet - several drawbacks from real-world experience will be discussed
* Swagger is the worldâ€™s largest framework for designing, generating code, and visualizing API's 
* Micro-services is not a language specific pattern, mixing languages and tools is normal 
* Micro-services may use http request/response or a message driven pattern
* Docker containers greatly improve predictability of micro-services deployments
* Public/Private Cloud PaaS (platform as a service) reduce TCO (total cost of ownership) specifically with micro-service architecture

## Audience ##

* Application Architects looking to familiarize themselves with micro-service architecture
* Developers eager to get first hand experience building micro-services 
* Operations looking to automate micro-services deployment and monitoring
* DevOps eager to jump into the modern software delivery mindset

## Course's Objectives ##
* Analyze industry motivation for adopting micro-service architecture
* Draw a comparison between SOA (service-oriented architecture) and Micro-service architecture
* Discover advantages and disadvantages of micro-services
* Get familiar with Swagger tool set
* Build micro-services using different languages
* Implement http and message driven design patter
* Experiment with deployment of micro-services using Docker
* Get familiar with public cloud PaaS DevOps model

## Prerequisites ##
